As a consumer, you are able to shop for products by category.

Upon choosing a category, all the products available in the category will show on the terminal. To order a product, simply type in the ID of the product you wish to purchase. You will be prompted for the desired quantity and if there are enough units available, a purchase confirmation will display. After a successful purchase, you will be prompted to either purchase another product or exit the console.

![A successful product purchase.](/images/purchaseSuccess-consumer.PNG "A successful product purchase.")

If there are less than the desired quantity in inventory, an error message and the available quantity of that product will pop up. You will not be able to place an order until you enter an available quantity.
